Simple Python script to convert a set of images to PDF and combine them into one single PDF file within seconds.

**Note**: The script works only for pictures clicked in portrait mode.

**Note**: The directory should not contain any subdirectories having images in them, i.e., the directory should contain only the images to be converted to PDF. The output PDF is saved in the same directory.
